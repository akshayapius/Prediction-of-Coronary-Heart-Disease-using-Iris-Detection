# Prediction-of-Coronary-Heart-Disease-using-Iris-Detection
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is still a major global health issue, which makes the creation of
sophisticated non-invasive diagnostic instruments necessary. Only 67% of medical professionals can
accurately predict heart disease, according to a WHO survey. Every ninety minutes, an adult in
New Zealand alone loses their life to heart disease; one in twenty adults, or approximately 180,000,
have the condition. There is much unrealized potential in medical records since ML models can be
used to not only diagnose but also predict the likelihood of high-risk diseases and conditions. This
can help physicians provide patients with the necessary care and help patients modify their lifestyle
to prevent such situations. This system, in particular, predicts the possibility that a person suffers
from a coronary heart disease by assessing the left iris of the patient. The project entails gathering
a variety of left iris image datasets and related clinical information, such as the presence of CHD.
A model is trained to identify minute patterns and characteristics in the iris that might point to
an a tendency to CHD using machine learning techniques. In order to guarantee strong predictive
capabilities, the model is adjusted and verified using well-established medical datasets.
An intuitive web interface is created in order to increase the predictive tool’s accessibility to a
larger group of people. Using this interface, users can upload a picture of their left iris with ease.
The trained model is used by the system to process the image, and the result is a quick and clear
indication of the probability of CHD. To help the user better understand the prediction results, the
web application also includes educational graphics and explanations. The project’s goal is to help
prevent cardiac arrest before it originates by giving people a simple, accessible, and non-invasive
way to determine their risk. The system’s practicality and usability are improved by the integration
of iris-based prediction with an intuitive web interface, which supports the system’s potential as
an effective screening tool for both individual health monitoring and healthcare settings.
